# Week 2: Advanced AI Concepts

This chapter discusses some advanced concepts in AI.

## Deep Learning

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning based on artificial neural networks. The "deep" in deep learning refers to the use of multiple layers in the network.

## Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how intelligent agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward.

## Generative Adversarial Networks

A generative adversarial network (GAN) is a class of machine learning frameworks designed by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in 2014. Two neural networks contest with each other in a game (in the sense of game theory, often but not always in the form of a zero-sum game).
